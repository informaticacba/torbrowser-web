Internet Freedom Nonprofit Seeks Rust Developer - Application deadline August 31, 2021

The Tor Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization advancing human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, is seeking two experienced Rust developers to be a part of the Network Team.

These developers will be an integral part of a small team that develops and maintains the networking software at the core of the Tor network, keeping it secure and improving it for the future. (Over the past 15 years, we've been developing the Tor implementation in C; but the time has finally come to migrate to Rust.)

The team coordinates both synchronously and asynchronously via IRC, email, bug trackers, and some voice meetings. A personal commitment to free and open source software, good communication and documentation skills, and passion for contributing to the greater good are all essential.

This is a full-time, remote position. Salary for this position is $90k - $110k USD, depending on experience, and there is voluntary opt-in salary transparency for employees and contractors.

- Good communication and documentation skills.
- Enthusiasm for teaching and learning within a distributed team.

### Preferred Qualifications

(These are good to have, but not required!)

- Experience with async/await programming in Rust.
- Experience with portable, cross-platform coding. (We work on Unix, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android, and we're aiming to expand to WASM.)
- Experience with developing large software projects, keeping them maintainable and flexible over time.
- Experience with API design and documentation.
- Familiarity with privacy, network programming, distributed systems, security, and cryptography.
- Familiarity with FOSS software engineering practices.
