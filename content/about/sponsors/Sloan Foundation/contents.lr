description:
The ALFRED P. SLOAN FOUNDATION is a not-for-profit, mission-driven grantmaking institution dedicated to
improving the welfare of all through the advancement of scientific knowledge. Established in 1934 by Alfred
Pritchard Sloan Jr., then-President and Chief Executive Officer of the General Motors Corporation, the
Foundation makes grants in four broad areas: direct support of research in science, technology,
engineering, mathematics, and economics; initiatives to increase the quality, equity, diversity, and
inclusiveness of scientific institutions and the science workforce; projects to develop or leverage technology
to empower research; and efforts to enhance and deepen public engagement with science and scientists. The Sloan Foundation has made an unrestricted, general operating grant to the Tor Project.
