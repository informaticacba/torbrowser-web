description:
If you're making non-commercial use of Tor software, you may also use the Tor onion logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products).
Please don't modify the design or colors of the logo.
You can use items that look like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point (e.g. an exploded onion with layers), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that would confuse people.
