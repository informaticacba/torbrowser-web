 C\n\n---\n\nEvery year\, governments\, law enforcement agencies\, militari
 es\, and corporations invest billions of dollars into building and buying 
 malicious spyware software designed to silently infiltrate a user's device
  and allow attackers to view the contents without detection.\n\nThis year\
 , the Pegasus Project revealed that users of this kind of spyware\, known 
 as Pegasus and built by the NSO group\, had targeted the phones that belon
 g to thousands of people in more than 50 countries\, including business ex
 ecutives\, politicians\, journalists\, and human rights activists.\n\nIn t
 his edition of PrivChat\, join Likhita and Etienne Maynier of Amnesty Inte
 rnational and John Scott Railton of Citizen Lab to discuss:\n\n- What can 
 individuals\, journalists\, activists\, and human rights defenders can do 
 to protect themselves against sophisticated spyware?\n- What kind of organ
 izations can we support to help stop this abuse?\n- Who is working on safe
 r\, more private software that we can trust?\n\nRoger Dingledine\, Co-Foun
 der of the Tor Project\, will join us as our host and moderator.\nhttps://
